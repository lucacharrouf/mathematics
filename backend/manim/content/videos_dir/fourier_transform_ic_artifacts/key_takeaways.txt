• Fourier Transform decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies, expressing it as a sum of sines and cosines.

• It converts signals from time domain to frequency domain, revealing which frequencies are present and their strengths.

• The transform is reversible—you can reconstruct the original function from its frequency components.

• Applications include signal processing, PDEs, quantum mechanics, and image compression.
