# Fourier Transform Visualization Scene Plan

## Scene Overview
This scene introduces the Fourier Transform, showing how a time-domain signal can be decomposed into its frequency components. Duration: 30 seconds.

## FRAME-BY-FRAME BREAKDOWN

### [00:00-00:05] Introduction
- **Title** appears at TOP ZONE (y=3): "Fourier Transform: Time to Frequency Domain"
- **Subtitle** fades in below title (y=2.5): "Decomposing signals into frequency components"
- **Explanatory text** appears in BOTTOM ZONE (y=-3): "The Fourier Transform converts a time-domain signal into its frequency representation"

### [00:05-00:12] Time Domain Signal
- **Time domain axes** appear in MIDDLE ZONE centered at (0,0)
  - X-axis labeled "Time (s)" spanning (-4, 4)
  - Y-axis labeled "Amplitude" spanning (-1.5, 1.5)
- **Composite signal** draws from left to right:
  - f(t) = sin(2πt) + 0.5sin(6πt)
  - Signal plotted from t=-4 to t=4
- **Formula** appears in BOTTOM ZONE (y=-3.5): "f(t) = sin(2πt) + 0.5sin(6πt)"

### [00:12-00:20] Transform Process
- **Explanatory text** updates: "The Fourier Transform identifies frequency components present in the signal"
- **Transform equation** appears at BOTTOM ZONE (y=-3.5): "F(ω) = ∫f(t)e^(-iωt)dt"
- **Transform animation**:
  - Original signal splits into its component sinusoids
  - First component sin(2πt) shifts up (y=1)
  - Second component 0.5sin(6πt) shifts down (y=-1)
  - Both components highlighted in different colors (red and blue)

### [00:20-00:30] Frequency Domain Result
- Time domain signal and components fade out
- **Frequency domain axes** appear in MIDDLE ZONE centered at (0,0)
  - X-axis labeled "Frequency (Hz)" spanning (0, 4)
  - Y-axis labeled "Magnitude" spanning (0, 1.5)
- **Frequency spikes** appear:
  - Spike at x=1 with height 1.0 (1 Hz component)
  - Spike at x=3 with height 0.5 (3 Hz component)
- **Final explanatory text** in BOTTOM ZONE (y=-3): "The Fourier Transform reveals two frequency components: 1 Hz and 3 Hz with magnitudes 1.0 and 0.5"
