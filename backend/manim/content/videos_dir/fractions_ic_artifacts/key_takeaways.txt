• Fractions represent parts of a whole, written as a/b where a is the numerator (parts counted) and b is the denominator (total parts).

• Equivalent fractions look different but represent the same value (1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6).

• When adding/subtracting fractions, the denominators must be the same.

• To multiply fractions, multiply numerators and denominators separately.
