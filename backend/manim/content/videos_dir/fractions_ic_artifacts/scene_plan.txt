# Scene Plan: Understanding Fractions

## FRAME-BY-FRAME BREAKDOWN

### [00:00-00:05] Introduction
- Title "Understanding Fractions" appears at TOP ZONE (0, 3) with scale 1.2
- Fade in explanatory text at BOTTOM ZONE (0, -3): "A fraction represents parts of a whole"
- Wait 2 seconds after text appears

### [00:05-00:12] First Concept: Fraction as Division
- Clear TOP ZONE, keep title
- In MIDDLE ZONE, a circle appears at (0, 0)
- Circle divides into 4 equal parts with dashed lines
- One part highlights in yellow
- Text in BOTTOM ZONE updates to (0, -3): "The fraction 1/4 means 1 part out of 4 equal parts"
- Fraction "1/4" appears at (-2, 0.5)
- Wait 2 seconds

### [00:12-00:20] Second Concept: Different Representations
- Circle transforms to a horizontal rectangle at (0, 0) with width 4, height 1
- Rectangle divides into 4 equal sections
- First section highlights in yellow
- Fraction "1/4" moves to (-2, 0.5)
- At (2, 0.5), a decimal "0.25" appears
- At (4, 0.5), percentage "25%" appears
- Text in BOTTOM ZONE updates to (0, -3): "Fractions can be written as decimals or percentages"
- Wait 2 seconds

### [00:20-00:30] Third Concept: Equivalent Fractions
- Clear middle animations except the rectangle
- Rectangle transforms to show 8 equal parts, with 2 parts highlighted in yellow
- Fraction "2/8" appears at (-2, 0.5)
- "=" sign appears at (0, 0.5)
- Fraction "1/4" appears at (2, 0.5)
- Text in BOTTOM ZONE updates to (0, -3): "Equivalent fractions represent the same amount"
- An arrow appears pointing to both fractions with text "Same value!" at (0, 1.5)
- Wait 2 seconds

## POSITIONING DETAILS

### Text Placements
- Title: Centered at (0, 3) in TOP ZONE
- Explanatory text: Centered at (0, -3) in BOTTOM ZONE with black background for readability
- Fraction labels: Positioned near their visual representations in MIDDLE ZONE

### Key Element Coordinates
- Main visual elements centered at (0, 0) in MIDDLE ZONE
- Circle/rectangle width: Never exceeds 4 units
- Visual dividers: Evenly spaced within shapes
- Fraction notations: Positioned at (-2, 0.5), (2, 0.5), and related positions
- Equivalent fraction arrow: From (-1, 1) to (1, 1)

### Transitions
- All transitions use smooth fade in/out with duration of 1 second
- Shape transformations occur over 1.5 seconds
- Highlighting of parts occurs over 0.8 seconds
- Text updates fade out old text before fading in new text

## MATHEMATICAL CONTENT

### Exact Equations/Notations
- Fraction notation: $\frac{1}{4}$
- Decimal notation: $0.25$
- Percentage notation: $25\%$
- Equivalent fraction: $\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}$

### Objects and Labels
- Circle: Labeled with fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ when one quarter is highlighted
- Rectangle: Initially divided into 4 parts, then 8 parts
- Parts labeled as "1 part" and "4 equal parts" in first example
- Equivalent parts labeled as "2 parts" and "8 equal parts" in third concept

### Mathematical Relationships Shown
- Fraction to decimal conversion: $\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$
- Fraction to percentage conversion: $\frac{1}{4} = 25\%$
- Equivalent fractions: $\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}$ (demonstrated visually)

This scene provides a clear, visually engaging explanation of fraction concepts while maintaining proper mathematical notation and visual organization.
